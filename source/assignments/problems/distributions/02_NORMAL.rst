Introduction

Standard Normal
---------------

1. Sketch a Standard Normal distribution in the x-y plane. Shade in the areas indicated in the problems below. Label the axes. Label each area with the percentage of the distribution that corresponds to the shaded region. Use a :ref:`z_table` to find the exact percentage.

	a. :math:`P(\mathcal{Z} \leq -1.62)`

	b. :math:`P(\mathcal{Z} \geq 1.62)`

	c. :math:`P(\mathcal{Z} \leq -1.96)`

	d. :math:`P(\mathcal{Z} \geq 1.96)`

	e. What is the relationship between parts *a* and *b*, and parts *c* and *d*? What characteristic of the Standard Normal distribution is being shown here? 

	f. :math:`P(\mathcal{Z} \leq -0.55)`

        g. :math:`P(\mathcal{Z} \geq 1.77)`

	h. :math:`P(\mathcal{Z} \leq 2.26)`

	i. :math:`P(\mathcal{Z} \geq -2.15)`


2. Sketch a Standard Normal distribution in the x-y plane. Shade in the areas indicated in the problems below. Label the axes. Label each area with the percentage of the distribution that corresponds to the shaded region. Use a :ref:`z_table` to find the exact percentage.

	a. :math:`P(-1.5 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 1.5)`

	b. :math:`P(-1.5 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 0)`

	c. :math:`P(0 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 1.5)`

	d. What is the relationship between parts *a*, *b* and *c*? Explain the result graphically. 

	e. :math:`P(0.33 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 1.05)`

	f. :math:`P(-1.17 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 2.21)`
	
3. Sketch a Standard Normal distribution in the x-y plane. Find the values of Z which correspond to the areas given below. Shade in the areas and label the axes with the value found. Use a :ref:`z_table` to solve the problem.

	a. 0.90
	
	b. 0.75

	c. 0.5 

	d. 0.25
	
	e. 0.10
	
4. **The Empirical Rule**

Since the Z-Table is the cumulative distribution function for the Standard Normal distribution, The :ref:`empirical_rule` can be derived through a Z-table. Recall the :ref:`empirical_rule` states,

.. topic:: Empirical Rule

	68% of a distribution is within one standard deviation of the mean.
	
	95% of a distribution is within two standard deviations of the mean.
	
	99% of a distribution is within three standard deviations of the mean.
	
This can be stated more precisely in terms of the **Z** distributions as follows,

.. topic:: Empirical Rule (Mathematical Version, z Distributions)

	.. math::
		
		P(-1 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 1) = 0.68
	
	.. math::
		
		P(-2 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 2) = 0.95
		
	.. math::
		
		P(-3 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 3) = 0.99

The *Empirical Rule* is an approximation, meant for quick calculations. It is not exact, as you will soon discover.

	a. Use a :ref:`z_table` to find the exact value of :math:`P(-1 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 1)`
	
	b. Use a :ref:`z_table` to find the exact value of :math:`P(-2 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 2)`
	
	c. Use a :ref:`z_table` to find the exact value of :math:`P(-3 \leq \mathcal{Z} \leq 3)`
