A bottle-filling machine is set to dispense 12.1 fluid ounces into juice bottles. To ensure that the machine is filling accurately, every hour a worker randomly selects four bottles filled by the machine during the past hour and measures the contents. If there is convincing evidence that the mean amount of juice dispensed is different from 12.1 ounces or if there is convincing evidence that the standard deviation is greater than 0.05 ounce, the machine is shut down for recalibration. It can be assumed that the amount of juice that is dispensed into bottles is normally distributed.

During one hour, the mean number of fluid ounces of four randomly selected bottles was 12.05 and the standard deviation was 0.085 ounce.

a. Perform a test of significance to determine whether the mean amount of juice dispensed is different from 12.1 fluid ounces. Assume the conditions for inference are met.

b. To determine whether this sample of four bottles provides convincing evidence that the standard deviation of the amount of juice dispensed is greater than 0.05 ounce, a simulation study was performed. In the simulation study, 300 samples, each of size 4, were randomly generated from a normal population with a mean of 12.1 and a standard deviation of 0.05. The sample standard deviation was computed for each
of the 300 samples. The dotplot below displays the values of the sample standard deviations.

Use the results of this simulation study to explain why you think the sample provides or does not provide
evidence that the standard deviation of the juice dispensed exceeds 0.05 fluid ounce.

The developers of a training program designed to improve manual dexterity claim that people who complete the 6-week program will increase their manual dexterity. A random sample of 12 people enrolled in the training program was selected. A measure of each person’s dexterity on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 9 (highest) was recorded just before the start of and just after the completion of the 6-week program. The data are shown in the table below.

Can one conclude that the mean manual dexterity for people who have completed the 6-week training program has significantly increased? Support your conclusion with appropriate statistical evidence.

Investigators at the U.S. Department of Agriculture wished to compare methods of determining the level of E. coli bacteria contamination in beef. Two different methods (A and B) of determining the level of contamination were used on each of ten randomly selected specimens of a certain type of beef. The data obtained, in millimicrobes/liter of ground beef, for each of the methods are shown in the table below.


+----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------+
| Specimen | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10    |
+----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------+
| Method A | 22.7 | 23.6 | 24.0 | 27.1 | 27.4 | 27.8 | 34.4 | 35.2 | 40.4 | 46. 8 |
+----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------+
| Method B | 23.0 | 23.1 | 23.7 | 26.5 | 26.6 | 27.1 | 33.2 | 35.0 | 40.5 | 47.8  |
+----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------+

Is there a significant difference in the mean amount of E. coli bacteria detected by the two methods for this type of beef? Provide a statistical justification to support your answer.

High cholesterol levels in people can be reduced by exercise, diet, and medication. Twenty middle-aged males with cholesterol readings between 220 and 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) of blood were randomly selected from the population of such male patients at a large local hospital. Ten of the 20 males were randomly assigned to group A, advised on appropriate exercise and diet, and also received a placebo. The other 10 males were assigned to group B, received the same advice on appropriate exercise and diet, but received a drug
intended to reduce cholesterol instead of a placebo. After three months, posttreatment cholesterol readings were taken for all 20 males and compared to pretreatment cholesterol readings. The tables below give the reduction in cholesterol level (pretreatment reading minus posttreatment reading) for each male in the study.

.. topic:: Group A (placebo)

	+----------------------+---+----+---+---+----+---+----+---+----+---+
	| Reduction (in mg/dL) | 2 | 19 | 8 | 4 | 12 | 8 | 17 | 7 | 24 | 1 |
	+----------------------+---+----+---+---+----+---+----+---+----+---+
	
	Mean Reduction: 10.20
	
	Standard Deviation of Reduction: 7.66
	
.. topic:: Group B (cholestrol drug)

	+----------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+----+
	| Reduction (in mg/dL) | 30 | 19 | 18 | 17 | 20 | -4 | 23 | 10 | 9 | 22 |
	+----------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+----+
	
	Mean Reduction: 16.40
	
	Standard Deviation of Reduction: 9.40
	
Do the data provide convincing evidence, at the :math:`\alpha = 0.01` level, that the cholesterol drug is effective in producing a reduction in mean cholesterol level beyond that produced by exercise and diet?
