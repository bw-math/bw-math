The manager of a public swimming pool wants to compare the effectiveness of two laundry detergents, Detergent A and Detergent B, in cleaning the towels that are used daily. As each dirty towel is turned in, it is placed into the only washing machine on the premises. When the washing machine contains 20 towels, the manager flips a coin to determine whether Detergent A or Detergent B will be used for that load. The cleanliness of the load of towels is rated on a scale of 1 to 10 by a person who does not know which detergent was used. The manager continues this experiment for many days. Which of the following best describes the manager's study?

    (A) A completely randomized design

    (B) A randomized block design with Detergent A and Detergent B as blocks

    (C) A randomized block design with the washing machine as the block

    (D) A matched-pairs design with Detergent A and Detergent B as the pair

    (E) An observational study

When a tractor pulls a plow through an agricultural field, the energy needed to pull that plow is called the draft. The draft is affected by environmental conditions such as soil type, terrain, and moisture. 

A study was conducted to determine whether a newly developed hitch would be able to reduce draft compared to the standard hitch. (A hitch is used to connect the plow to the tractor.) Two large plots of land were used in this study. It was randomly determined which plot was to be plowed using the standard hitch. As the tractor plowed that plot, a measurement device on the tractor automatically recorded the draft at 25 randomly selected points in the plot.

After the plot was plowed, the hitch was changed from the standard one to the new one, a process that takes a substantial amount of time. Then the second plot was plowed using the new hitch. Twenty-five measurements of draft were also recorded at randomly selected points in this plot.

a. What was the response variable in this study?
 
b. Identify the treatments.
 
c. What were the experimental units?

d. Given that the goal of the study is to determine whether a newly developed hitch reduces draft compared to the standard hitch, was randomization used properly in this study? Justify your answer.

e. Given that the goal of the study is to determine whether a newly developed hitch reduces draft compared to the standard hitch, was replication used properly in this study? Justify your answer.

f. Plot of land is a confounding variable in this experiment. Explain why.

Agricultural experts are trying to develop a bird deterrent to reduce costly damage to crops in the United States. An experiment is to be conducted using garlic oil to study its effectiveness as a nontoxic, environmentally safe bird repellant. The experiment will use European starlings, a bird species that causes considerable damage annually to the corn crop in the United States. Food granules made from corn are to be infused with garlic oil in each of five concentrations of garlic —0 percent, 2 percent, 10 percent, 25 percent, and 50 percent. The researchers will determine the adverse reaction of the birds to the repellant by measuring the number of food granules consumed during a two-hour period following overnight food deprivation. There are forty birds available for the experiment, and the researchers will use eight birds for each concentration of garlic. Each bird will be kept in a separate cage and provided with the same number of food granules.

a. For the experiment, identify: the treatments, the experimental units, the response that will be measured.

Researchers are investigating the effectiveness of using a fungus to control the spread of an insect that destroys trees. The researchers will create four different concentrations of fungus mixtures: 0 milliliters per liter (ml/L), 1.25 ml/L, 2.5 ml/L, and 3.75 ml/L. An equal number of the insects will be placed into 20 individual containers. The group of insects in each container will be sprayed with one of the four mixtures, and the researchers will record the number of insects that are still alive in each container one week after spraying.

a. Identify the treatments, experimental units, and response variable of the experiment.

b. Does the experiment have a control group? Explain your answer.

c. Describe how the treatments can be randomly assigned to the experimental units so that each treatment has the same number of units.

As dogs age, diminished joint and hip health may lead to joint pain and thus reduce a dog’s activity level. Such a reduction in activity can lead to other health concerns such as weight gain and lethargy due to lack of exercise. A study is to be conducted to see which of two dietary supplements, glucosamine or chondroitin, is more effective in promoting joint and hip health and reducing the onset of canine osteoarthritis. Researchers will randomly select a total of 300 dogs from ten different large veterinary practices around the country. All of the dogs are more than 6 years old, and their owners have given consent to participate in the study. Changes in joint and hip health will be evaluated after 6 months of treatment.

a. What would be an advantage to adding a control group in the design of this study?

b. Assuming a control group is added to the other two groups in the study, explain how you would assign the 300 dogs to these three groups for a completely randomized design.

c. Rather than using a completely randomized design, one group of researchers proposes blocking on clinics, and another group of researchers proposes blocking on breed of dog. How would you decide which one of these two variables to use as a blocking variable?

A manufacturer of toxic pesticide granules plans to use a dye to color the pesticide so that birds will avoid eating it. A series of experiments will be designed to find colors or patterns that three bird species (blackbirds, starlings, and geese) will avoid eating. Representative samples of birds will be captured to use in the experiments, and the response variable will be the amount of time a hungry bird will avoid eating food of a particular color or pattern.

a. Previous research has shown that male birds do not avoid solid colors. However, it is possible that males might avoid colors displayed in a pattern, such as stripes. In an effort to prevent males from eating the pesticide, the following two treatments are applied to the pesticide granules.


	Treatment 1: A red background with narrow blue stripes
	

	Treatment 2: A blue background with narrow red stripes

To increase the power of detecting a difference in the two treatments in the analysis of the experiment, the researcher decided to block on the three species of birds (blackbirds, starlings, and geese). Assuming there are 100 birds of each of the three species, explain how you would assign birds to treatments in such a block design.

b. Other than blocking, what could the researcher do to increase the power of detecting a difference in the two treatments in the analysis of the experiment? Explain how your approach would increase the power.

In response to nutrition concerns raised last year about food served in school cafeterias, the Smallville School District entered into a one-year contract with the Healthy Alternative Meals (HAM) company. Under this contract, the company plans and prepares meals for 2,500 elementary, middle, and high school students, with a focus on good nutrition. The school administration would like to survey the students in the district to estimate the proportion of students who are satisfied with the food under this contract.

Two sampling plans for selecting the students to be surveyed are under consideration by the administration. One plan is to take a simple random sample of students in the district and then survey those students. The other plan is to take a stratified random sample of students in the district and then survey those students.

a. Describe a simple random sampling procedure that the administrators could use to select 200 students from the 2,500 students in the district.

b. If a stratified random sampling procedure is used, give one example of an effective variable on which to stratify in this survey. Explain your reasoning.

c. Describe one statistical advantage of using a stratified random sample over a simple random sample in the context of this study.

a. For convenience, the apartment building owner wants to use a cluster sampling method, in which the floors are clusters, to select the eight apartments. Describe a process for randomly selecting eight different apartments using this method.

b. An alternative sampling method would be to select a stratified random sample of eight apartments, where the strata are apartments with children and apartments with no children. A stratified random sample of size eight might include two randomly selected apartments with children and six randomly selected apartments with no children. In the context of this situation, give one statistical advantage of selecting such a stratified sample as opposed to a cluster sample of eight apartments using the floors as clusters.

9. Students are designing an experiment to compare the productivity of two varieties of dwarf fruit trees. The site for the experiment is a field that is bordered by a densely forested area on the west side. The field has been divided into eight plots of approximately the same area. The students have decided that the test plots should be blocked. Four trees, each of two varieties, will be assigned at random to the
four plots within each block, with one tree planted in each plot.

The two blocking schemes shown below are under consideration. For each scheme, one block is identified by the white region and the other block indicated by the grey region in the figures.

a. Which of the blocking schemes , A or B, is better for this experiment? Explain.

b. Even though the students have decided to block, they must randomly assign the varieties of the trees to the plots within each block. What is the purpose of this randomization in the context of the experiment?

9. The dentists in a dental clinic would like to determine if there is a difference between the number of new cavities in people who eat an apple a day and in people who eat less than one apple a week. They are going to conduct a study with 50 people in each group.

Fifty clinics patients who report that they routinely eat an apple a day and 50 clinic patients who report that they eat less than one apple a week will be identified. The dentists will examine the patients and their records to determine the number of new cavities the patients have had over the past two years. They will then compare the number of new cavities in the two groups.

a. Why is this an observational study and not an experiment?

b. Explain the concept of confounding in the context of this study. Include an example of a possible confounding variable.

c. If the mean number of new cavities for those who ate an apple a day was statistically significantly smaller than the mean number of new cavities for those who ate less than one apple a week, could one conclude that the lower number of new cavities can be attributed to eating an apple a day? Explain.

10. A biologist is interested in studying the effect of growth-enhancing nutrients an differernt salinity (salt) levels in water on the growth of shrimps. The biologist has ordered a large shipment of young tiger shrimps from a supply house for use in the study. The experiment is to be conducted in a laboratory where 10 tiger shrimps are placed randomly into each of 12 similar tanks in a controlled environment.

The biologist is planning to use 3 different growth-enhancing nutrients (A, B, and C) and two different
salinity levels (low and high).

a. List the treatments that the biologist plans to use in this experiment.

b. Using the treatments listed in part (a), describe a completely randomized design that will allow the biologist to compare the shrimps’ growth after 3 weeks.

c. Give one statistical advantage to having only tiger shrimps in the experiment. Explain why this is an advantage.

d. Give one statistical disadvantage to having only tiger shrimps in the experiment. Explain why this is a disadvantage.

11. A manufacturer of boots plans to conduct an experiment to compare a new method of waterproofing to the current method. The appearance of the boots is not changed by either method. The company recruits 100 volunteers in Seattle, where it rains frequently, to wear the boots as they normally would for 6 months. At the end of the 6 months, the boots will be returned to the company to be evaluated for water damage.

a. Describe a design for this experiment that uses the 100 volunteers. Include a few sentences on how it would be implemented.

b. Could your design be double blind? Explain
