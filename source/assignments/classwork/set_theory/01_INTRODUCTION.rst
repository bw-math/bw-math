.. topic:: Instructions

    Start a fresh page in your classwork notebook. Write today's date in the margin of the page. Clearly label and solve each of the following. Show your work and circle the anwer. 

For the problems #1 -9, you are given,

.. math:: 
    
    S = \{ 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 19, 19, 31, 50, 81 \}

.. math:: 

    A = \{ 1, 2, 3, 19 \}

.. math:: 

    B = \{ 19, 50, 81 \}

.. math:: 

    C = \{ 2, 12, 19, 50, 81 \}

.. math:: 

    D = \{ 31, 50 \}

Where **S** is the universal set and **A**, **B**, **C** and **D** are subsets of **S**.
