.. topic:: Instructions

    Start a fresh page in your classwork notebook. Write today's date in the margin of the page. Clearly label and solve each of the following. Show your work and circle the anwer. 

For the problems #1 -9, you are given,

.. math:: 
    
    S = \{ 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 19, 19, 31, 50, 81 \}

.. math:: 

    A = \{ 1, 2, 3, 19 \}

.. math:: 

    B = \{ 19, 50, 81 \}

.. math:: 

    C = \{ 2, 12, 19, 50, 81 \}

.. math:: 

    D = \{ 31, 50 \}

Where **S** is the universal set and **A**, **B**, **C** and **D** are subsets of **S**.

5. **Ordered Pairs**

Set theory is the foundation of all modern mathematics. For example, `Kazimierz Kuratowski <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazimierz_Kuratowski>`_, a Polish mathematician, proposed the following `definition of an ordered pair <https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1767604/please-explain-kuratowski-definition-of-ordered-pairs>`_,

.. topic:: Kuratowski's Definition of an Ordered Pair

	Let :math:`(a,b)` represent the set, 
	
	.. math::
		
		\{ \{ a \}, \{ a, b \} \}
		
Use Kuratowski's definition of an ordered pair to decide which of the following propositions is true:

	a. :math:`a \in (a,b)`
	
	b. :math:`\{ a \} \in (a,b)`
	
	c. :math:`(a,a)=\{ a \}`
	
	d. :math:`b \in (a,b)`
	
	e. :math:`\{ b \} \in (a,b)`
	
	f. :math:`\{ a, b \} \in (a,b)`
	
Theorems
========

1. **Symbolic Propositions**

Let **E**, **F** and **G** be three events. Determine which of the following statements are correct and which are incorrect. Justify your answers.

	a. :math:`(F^c \cap G) \cup (E^c \cap G) = G \cap ((F \cup E)^c)`
	
	b. :math:`((E \cup F)^c) \cap G = (E^c) \cap (F^c) \cap (G)`

	c. :math:`((E \cap F) \cup (E \cap G) \cup (F \cap G)) \subset (E \cup F \cup G)`
	 
2. **Deductive Proofs** 

Suppose you are given two sets **E** and **F**. Using the properties of sets discussed in class and the ones covered in this classwork, derive an identity for each of the following expressions,

    a. :math:`(E \cap F^c) \cup (E \cap F)`

    b. :math:`(E \cup F^c) \cap (E \cup F)`

.. hint:: 

    Use the distributive laws from #5 and then use the `Complement Theorem <complement_theorem>`
