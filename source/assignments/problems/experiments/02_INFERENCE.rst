1. **2012, Free Response, #3**

Independent random samples of 500 households were taken from a large metropolitan area in the United States for the years 1950 and 2000. Histograms of household size (number of people in a household) for the years are shown below.

Use this information to answer the following questions.

	a. Compare the distributions of household size in the metropolitan area for the years 1950 and 2000.

	b. A researcher wants to use these data to construct a confidence interval to estimate the change in mean household size in the metropolitan area from the year 1950 to the year 2000. State the conditions for using a two-sample t-procedure, and explain whether the conditions for inference are met.
	
2. **2008, Free Response, #2**

Four different statistics have been proposed as estimators of a population parameter. To investigate the behavior of these estimators, 500 random samples are selected from a known population and each statistic is calculated for each sample. The true value of the population parameter is 75. The graphs below show the distribution of values for each statistic.

Use the information to solve the following problems.

	a. Which of the statistics appear to be unbiased estimators of the population parameter? How can you tell?

	b. Which of statistics A or B would be a better estimator of the population parameter? Explain your choice.

	c. Which of statistics C or D would be a better estimator of the population parameter? Explain your choice.
