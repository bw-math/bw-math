Use this information to answer the following questions.

	a. Compare the distributions of household size in the metropolitan area for the years 1950 and 2000.

	b. A researcher wants to use these data to construct a confidence interval to estimate the change in mean household size in the metropolitan area from the year 1950 to the year 2000. State the conditions for using a two-sample t-procedure, and explain whether the conditions for inference are met.
