    Start a fresh page in your classwork notebook. Write today's date in the margin of the page. Clearly label and solve each of the following. Show your work and circle the anwer. 

Electric Vehicle Distribution
=============================

The United States Government General Services Administration maintains a huge database of public available information. One of the datasets they publish is the `Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data>`_

A random sample of 18 eletric vehicles was selected from this dataset and the *make* of the car was recorded. The resuls are given below,

    BMW, FORD, CHEVROLET, TESLA, FORD, BMW, VOLVO, TESLA, TESLA, NISSAN, CHEVROLET, BMW, TESLA, NISSAN, CHEVROLET, TESLA, TESLA, CHEVROLET

1. What is the population being sampled in this experiment?
   
2. Construct a relative frequency distribution and histogram for this sample of data. Label the axes. What is the most common (frequent) electric vehicle make in this sample of data?

3. Based on this sample, can we conclude your answer to #2 is the most common eletric vehicle make in the United States? Why or why not? 

.. note:: 

    We will come back and examine this dataset again at various points in the class.

Twitter by Tweets and Followers
===============================

.. important:: 

    The data will be downloaded directly onto the your calculator in class via a cable link. 

    If you want to try out the dataset in **Python** at any point, you can download the full dataset `here <../../assets/datasets/celebrity_twitter_data.csv>`_

The following table lists the top 20 **Twitter** users by follower count (as of 2022).

A research center conducted a national survey about teenage behavior. Teens were asked whether they had consumed a soft drink in the past week. The following table shows the counts for three independent random samples from major cities.

+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
|       | Baltimore | Detroit | San Diego | Total |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
| Yes   | 727       | 1,232   | 1,482     | 3,441 |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
| No    | 177       | 431     | 798       | 1,406 |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+
| Total | 904       | 1,663   | 2,280     | 4,847 |
+-------+-----------+---------+-----------+-------+

    a. Suppose one teen is randomly selected from each city's sample. A researcher claims that the likelihood of selecting a teen from Baltimore who consumed a soft drink in the past week is less than the likelihood of selecting a teen from either one of the other cities who consumed a soft drink in the past week because Baltimore has the least number of teens who consumed a soft drink. Is the researcher's claim correct? Explain your answer.

    b. Consider the values in the table. Construct a segmented bar chart of relative frequencies based on the information in the table. 
    
    c. Which city had the smallest proportion of teens who consumed a soft drink in the previous week? Determine the value of the proportion.

The chemicals in clay used to make pottery can differ depending on the geographical region where the clay originated. Sometimes, archaeologists use a chemical analysis of clay to help identify where a piece of pottery originated. Such an analysis measures the amount of a chemical in the clay as a percent of the total weight of the piece of pottery. The boxplots below summarize analyses done for three chemicals—X, Y, and Z—on pieces of pottery that originated at one of three sites: I, II, or III.

.. image:: ../../../assets/imgs/classwork/2017_apstats_frp_04.png

Use this information to answer the following questions.

    a. For chemical Z, describe how the percents found in the pieces of pottery are similar and how they differ among the three sites.

    b. Consider a piece of pottery known to have originated at one of the three sites, but the actual site is not known.

        i. Suppose an analysis of the clay reveals that the sum of the percents of the three chemicals X, Y, and Z is 20.5%. Based on the boxplots, which site—I, II, or III—is the most likely site where the piece of pottery originated? Justify your choice.

        ii. Suppose only one chemical could be analyzed in the piece of pottery. Which chemical—X, Y, or Z— would be the most useful in identifying the site where the piece of pottery originated? Justify your choice.

Product advertisers studied the effects of television ads on children's choices for two new snacks. The advertisers used two 30-second television ads in an experiment. One ad was for a new sugary snack called Choco-Zuties, and the other ad was for a new healthy snack called Apple-Zuties.

For the experiment, 75 children were randomly assigned to one of three groups, A, B, or C. Each child individually watched a 30-minute television program that was interrupted for 5 minutes of advertising. The advertising was the same for each group with the following exceptions.

- The advertising for group A included the Choco-Zuties ad but not the Apple-Zuties ad.
- The advertising for group B included the Apple-Zuties ad but not the Choco-Zuties ad.
- The advertising for group C included neither the Choco-Zuties ad nor the Apple-Zuties ad.

After the program, the children were offered a choice between the two snacks. The table below summarizes their choices.

As gasoline prices have increased in recent years, many drivers have expressed concern about the taxes they pay on gasoline for their cars. In the United States, gasoline taxes are imposed by both the federal government and by individual states. The boxplot above shows the distribution of the state gasoline taxes, in cents per gallon, for all 50 states on January 1, 2006.

a. Based on the boxplot, what are the approximate values of the median and the interquartile range of the distribution of state gasoline taxes, in cents per gallon? Mark and label the boxplot to indicate how you found the approximated values.

b. The federal tax imposed on gasoline was 18.4 cents per gallon at the time the state taxes were in effect. The federal gasoline tax was added to the state gasoline tax for each state to create a new distribution of combined gasoline taxes. What are approximate values, in cents per gallon, of the median and interquartile range of the new distribution of combined gasoline taxes? Justify your answer.
