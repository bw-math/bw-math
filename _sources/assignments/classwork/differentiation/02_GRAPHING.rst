Let f be a function that is continuous on the interval :math:`[0, 4)` . The function f is twice differentiable except at :math:`x = 2`. The function f and its derivatives have the properties indicated in the table above, where DNE indicates that the derivatives of f do not exist at x = 2.

a. For :math:`0 < x < 4`, find all values of x at which f has a relative extremum. Determine whether f has a relative maximum or a relative minimum at each of these values. Justify your answer.

b. Sketch the graph of a function that has all the characteristics of f .

The figure above is the graph of a function of x, which models the height of a skateboard ramp. The function meets the following requirements.

	i. At :math:`x = 0`, the value of the function is 0, and the slope of the graph of the function is 0.
	ii. At :math:`x = 4`, the value of the function is 1, and the slope of the graph of the function is 1.
	iii. Between :math:`x = 0` and :math:`x = 4`, the function is increasing.

a. Let :math:`f(x) = a x ^ 2` , where :math:`a` is a nonzero constant. Show that it is not possible to find a value for a so that :math:`f` meets requirement *ii* above.

c. Using the function :math:`g` and your value of :math:`c` from part *b*, show that :math:`g` does not meet requirement *iii* above.

d. Let :math:`h(x) = \frac{x^n}{k}`, where :math:`k` is a nonzero constant and :math:`n` is a postive integer. Find the values of :math:`k` and :math:`n` so that :math:`h` meets requirement *ii* above. Show that *h* also meets requirements *i* and *ii* above.
