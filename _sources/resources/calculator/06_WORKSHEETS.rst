	If you are reading this, then I have probably been sucked into a jet engine or struck by falling debris. As such, I will not be able to teach this class until they are able to reassemble my pieces into a Frankenstein-esque monster. 
	
	In the meantime, you will find resources on this page to keep the class occupied.

.. important::
	
	Some of these worksheets require datasets. These datasets will need imported onto the students' calculators. Use the `TI Connect CE <https://education.ti.com/html/eguides/connectivity/TI-Connect-CE/EN/Index.HTML>`_ program installed on the classroom *ViewSonic* to export the data onto the students' calculators. Hook up the calculators using miniUSB cables and then send the data using the options menu in the *TI Connect CE* program.
