Duck Quackery
=============

No statistician's tool belt is complete without an absurd number of Rubber Ducks! Rubber Ducks provide countless opportunities for statistics and probability demonstrations! 

.. topic:: Required Materials
	
	- Rubber ducks! Get two different colors (e.g., red and blue) and two different sizes (e.g., small and large). There should be overlap between the partitions. In other words, some blue ducks should be small and some blue ducks should be large. Same goes for red!
	- Masking tape
