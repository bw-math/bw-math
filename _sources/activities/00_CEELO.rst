	- Poker Chips

In Cee-Lo, one player is designed the bank. The other players make bets against the bank. The bank is required to match each player bet at the beginning of a round.

Distribute a stack of chips to each player. Ensure the bank has a sufficient amount of chips to match all bets. As an example, if there are five players with ten chips each, the bank should have fifty chips.  

The bank rolls first. The possibile outcomes are as follows,

- If the bank rolls a ``4, 5, 6``, then the bank automatically wins each of the players' bets. 
- If the bank rolls three of the same number (**Trips**), then the bank automatically wins each of the players' bets
- If the bank rolls a ``1,2,3``, then the bank loses and the players wins their bets.
- If the bank rolls two of one number and one of a different number (e.g., ``1, 1, 5``), then the third number is the score for the roll and becomes the **Banker's Point** (e.g., ``5`` would be the point for a roll of ``1, 1, 5``). 
- If the banker does not roll an immediate winning or losing combination, and does not roll a point, then the bank continues to roll until one of these things happens.

If the bank rolls a point, then it becomes the players' turn. Each player has their own turn. 

- If a player rolls a ``4, 5, 6``, then the player automatically wins their bet. 
- If a player rolls three of the same number (**Trips**), then the player automatically wins their bet.
- If a player rolls a ``1, 2, 3``, the player automatically loses.
- If a player rolls two of one number and one of a different number, then the third number is the score and becomes the **Player's Point**.
- If the player rolls a point higher than the bank, the player wins.
- If the player rolls a point lower than the bank, the player loses.
- If the player rolls the same point as the bank, then it is a **Push**. The player neither wins or loses and their bet is returned without the bank paying out.
