Probability Pictionary
======================

*Probability Pictionary* is a fun to learn statistical terms and definitions!

.. topic:: Required Materials

	- Torture Wheel (i.e., some sort of random selection process: dice, names in a hat, etc.)
	- Notecards/Post-It Notes/Paper
	- Whiteboard/Chalkboard
	- Dry Erase Markers/Chalk
	- Imagination!

Probability Pictionary is composed of rounds. Each round, the Torture Wheel will select a contestant to be the **Victim**. The **Victim** must select a random card and then create an illustration on the board. The goal is to get the rest of the class to guess what term or definition was written on the card. The **Victim** wins if someone in the class guesses correctly.

Setup
-----

Write statistical terms and definitions on the notecards and then mix them up in a box.

Rules
-----

1. The Torture Wheel selects a **Victim**.

2. The pot is set to 1 point.

3. The **Victim** selects a random card. 

4. The **Victim** may either take the card or pass.

5. If the **Victim** takes the card, the Victim has one minute on the clock.

6. During the minute, the **Victim** may draw whatever he or she pleases on the whiteboard with any color marker. No words, numbers or speaking are allowed. During this, the audience may buzz in and guess what term the **Victim** is trying to illustrate. If someone guesses correctly, both the **Victim** and the guesser win the pot.

7. If the time expires without a correct guess OR the **Victim** passes, a point is added to the pot. The Torture Wheel will then select the next **Victim**. Once a **Victim** is released from servitude, they must sit out the rest of the round, i.e. until a new card is drawn.

8. This process continues until all players have been eliminated or someone guesses correctly.

9. Restart from Step 1 until there are no more cards.
