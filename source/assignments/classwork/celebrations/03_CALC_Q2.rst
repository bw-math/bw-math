Let :math:`f`` be the function defined for :math:`x \geq 0` with :math:`f (0) = 5` and :math:`f^{\prime}`, the first derivative of :math:`f`, given by :math:`f^{\prime}( x ) = e ^{ - \frac{x}{4} } \cdot \sin{x^2}`. The graph of :math:`y = f^{\prime}( x )` is shown above.

a. Use the graph of :math:`f^{\prime}` to determine whether the graph of :math:`f` is concave up, concave down, or neither on the interval :math:`1.7 < x < 1.9`. Explain your reasoning.

b. On the interval :math:`0 \leq x \leq 3`, find the value of x at which f has an absolute maximum. Justify your answer.
