Experimental Design
===================

The key to eliminating bias and making sound statistical inferences is *good experimental design*.

Definitions 
-----------

Experimental Unit
    The entity (person, object, thing) being observed in an experiment.

Treatment
    The condition applied in an experiment.

.. topic:: Phraseology

    The *experimental unit* receives *treatments*. 

    *Treatments* are applied to *experimental units*.

Indicator Variable 
    An *indicator* variable is the variable over which the researcher has control.

Response Variable 
    A *response* variable is the variable measured by the researcher. 

.. note:: 

    *Indicator* variables are sometimes known as either *explanatory* variables or *independent variables*.

    *Response* variables are sometimes known as either *explicated* variables or *dependent variables*.

Example
    A researcher changes the pH concentration of a solution and measures the temperature at various concentrations.

In this example, the *indicator* or *explanatory* variable is the *pH contentration*. The researcher is able to change the amount of acid or base that is added to the solution. The *response* variable is the temperature of the solution.

Blind Studies
-------------

The concept of *blind studies* mainly applies to the areas of psychology and medicine. These sciences deal with human nature and humans are, if nothing else, peculiar creatures. Their expectations can influence the results of the experiment.

In medical studies, the *test* group will receive the real treatment while the *control* group will receive a *placebo* treatment. For example, in testing whether a certain drug treats a medical condition, the *control* group would receive a sugar pill. Yet it sometimes occurs the *control* group experiences the effects of the *real treatment* simply by *expecting* the effect,

    The *Placebo Effect* occurs when individuals in the *control group* appear as if they have received *treatment*. 

To minimize the *Placebo Effect*, *single blind* and *double blind* studies are performed.

Single Blind
    In a single blind study, the participant does not know whether he or she is in the *control* or *test* group. However, the researcher *does* know.

Double Blind
    In a double blind study, neither the participant nor the researcher administering the treatment know if the individual is in the *control* or *test* group.

Matched Pairs 
-------------

A *matched pairs* design is an experimental design where researchers match pairs of participants by relevant characteristics. Then the researchers randomly assign one person from each pair to the treatment group and the other to the control group. This type of experiment is also known as a matching pairs design.

An ideal example of a *matched pairs design* would be twins,

If one of the twins is submitted to a *treatment*, their genetically identical counterpart serves as a nearly perfect *control*. 

Randomized Blocks
-----------------

A *randomized block* experiment should be understood a series of identical experiments, where each *block* of the population sampled is composed of the same distribution of individuals. 

A *randomized block* design is commonly encountered in *agricultural* applications. Consider a farmer who wants to test a new type of seed against his usual stock to determine if the yield is higher. In a *randomized block* experiment, he would break his plots of land into *blocks*, and then partition each block into segments, call them *A*, *B*, *C* and *D*,

    :align: center

The type of seed would be planted in the *A* segment of each block, i.e. the *A* segment would receive a *treatment*, while the other segments would be planted with the farmer's usual stock. Data would then be collected from each block and analyzed in isolation to determine if the new type of seed has any benefits. 

In essence, each *block* represents a separate experiment, where the treated group is tested against the control group.
