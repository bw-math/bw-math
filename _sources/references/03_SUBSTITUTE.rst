	If you are reading this, then I have probably been sucked into a jet engine or struck by falling debris. As such, I will not be able to teach this class until they are able to reassemble my pieces into a Frankenstein-esque monster. 
	
	In the meantime, you will find resources on this page to keep the class occupied while you catch up on your precious sleep. 
	
.. important::

	Before class starts, throw a slab of raw meat into the center of the room. Allow the students to fight over said meat until a clear victor emerges. After the students have settled down and submitted to the alpha, you may start class.

	Some of these worksheets require datasets. These datasets will need imported on the students' calculator. You can have the students connect to the *ViewSonic* by plugging into the USB splitter. Then, you will need to open the *TI-Connect* software and send the dataset to their calculators.  One of the students (not Sejal) should be able to figure out how to import the data.
