The :ref:`conditions for a Binomial Random Variable <binomial_conditions>` are given below,

.. topic:: Binomial Conditions

	1. The number of trials :math:`n` must be fixed.
	
	2. Each trial must be independent of the others.
	
	3. Each trial must have a binary outcome, usually denoted success or failure.  
	
	4. The probability of success is the same in each trial.
	
Determine whether each of the following experiments satisfies the conditions for a Binomial Random Variable. If it does not satisfy the conditions for a Binomial Random Variable, state which condition is violated and why.

	a. A student is taking a multiple choice quiz. The quiz has 10 questions, with four possible answers each. Each question has only one correct answer. The student randomly guesses on each question. Let

2. **Probability Density**

.. topic:: Binomial Probability Density Function

	.. math::

		P(\mathcal{X}=x) = C^{n}_{r} \cdot p^x \cdot (1-p)^{n-x}
		
Use the Binomal Probability Density Function to answer the following questions.

	a. Before performing any calculations, answer the following questions. 
	
		i. If you flip a fair coin ten times, how many heads do you expect to get on average? 
		
		ii. If you perform :math:`n` trials where each trial has a probability of success :math:`p`, how many successes do you expect to get on average? 
	
	b. If :math:`n=10` and :math:`p=0.5`, find :math:`P(\mathcal{X}=3)`.

	g. Write a few sentence in plain English interpretting the results of *part b - f*. What happens to Binomial probabilities on either side of the *expected value* of the distribution as you move away from that point? What features of the distribution are apparent from the calculations performed in *parts b - f*? 

3. **Applications**

	a. Suppose that only 25% of all drivers come to a complete stop at an intersection having flashing red lights in all directions when no other cars are visible. You stand at the intersection and randomly sample 20 cars as they pass through the intersection.

		i. What is the probability at most 5 will come to a complete stop?
		
		ii. What is the probability exactly 6 will come to a complete stop?
	
		iii. What is the probability at least 7 will come to a complete stop?

4. **Normal Approximation**

The :ref:`normal_distribution` can be used to approximate the Binomal Distribution under certain conditions. These conditions are given below for quick reference,

.. topic:: Conditions for Binomial Approximation
   
    :math:`n \cdot p \geq 10`

    :math:`n \cdot (1 - p) \geq 10`
    
Use these conditions to determine whether the following Binomial Random Variables can be approximated with the Normal Distribution. In each case, calculate the exact Binomial probability. If the Normal approximation is applicable, calculate the approximate probability and compare it to the exact value.

At an archaeological site that was an ancient swamp, the bones from 20 brontosaur skeletons have been unearthed. The bones do not show any sign of disease or malformation. It is thought that these animals wandered into a deep area of the swamp and became trapped in the swamp bottom. The 20 left femur bones (thigh bones) were located and 4 of these left femurs are to be randomly selected without replacement for DNA testing to determine gender.

a. Let X be the number out of the 4 selected left femurs that are from males. Based on how these bones were sampled, explain why the probability distribution of X is not binomial.

.. hint:: 

    Are you selecting the femurs *with* or *without* replacement? What does this tell you about the *independence* of observations in this sample?

b. Suppose that the group of 20 brontosaurs whose remains were found in the swamp had been made up of 10 males and 10 females. What is the probability that all 4 in the sample to be tested are male?

c. The DNA testing revealed that all 4 femurs tested were from males. Based on this result and your answer from part *b**, do you think that males and females were equally represented in the group of 20 brontosaurs stuck in the swamp? Explain.

d. Is it reasonable to generalize your conclusion in part *c* pertaining to the group of 20 brontosaurs to the population of all brontosaurs? Explain why or why not.

Sunshine Farms wants to know whether there is a difference in consumer preference for two new juice productsâ€”Citrus Fresh and Tropical Taste. In an initial blind taste test, 8 randomly selected consumers were given unmarked samples of the two juices. The product that each consumer tasted first was randomly decided by the flip of a coin. After tasting the two juices, each consumer was asked to choose which juice he or she preferred, and the results were recorded.

a. Let *p* represent the population proportion of consumers who prefer Citrus Fresh. In terms of *p*, state the hypotheses that Sunshine Farms is interested in testing.

b. One might consider using a one-proportion z-test to test the hypotheses in part *#a*. Explain why this would not be a reasonable procedure for this sample.

c. Let X represent the number of consumers in the sample who prefer Citrus Fresh. Assuming there is no difference in consumer preference, find the probability for each possible value of X. Record the x-values and the corresponding probabilities in the table below.

A tire manufacturer designed a new tread pattern for its all-weather tires. Repeated tests were conducted on cars of approximately the same weight traveling at 60 miles per hour. The tests showed that the new tread pattern enables the cars to stop completely in an average distance of 125 feet with a standard deviation of 6.5 feet and that the stopping distances are approximately normally distributed.

a. What is the 70th percentile of the distribution of stopping distances?

b. What is the probability that at least 2 cars out of 5 randomly selected cars in the study will stop in a distance that is greater than the distance calculated in *part a* ?

c. What is the probability that a randomly selected sample of 5 cars in the study will have a mean stopping distance of at least 130 feet?

A machine at a manufacturing company is programmed to fill shampoo bottles such that the amount of shampoo in each bottle is normally distributed with mean 0.60 liter and standard deviation 0.04 liter. Let the random variable **A** represent the amount of shampoo, in liters, that is inserted into a bottle by the filling machine.

a. A bottle is considered to be underfilled if it has less than 0.50 liter of shampoo. Determine the probability that a randomly selected bottle of shampoo will be underfilled. Show your work.

b. After the bottles are filled, they are placed in boxes of 10 bottles per box. After the bottles are placed in the boxes, several boxes are placed in a crate for shipping to a beauty supply warehouse. The manufacturing company's contract with the beauty supply warehouse states that one box will be randomly selected from a crate. If 2 or more bottles in the selected box are underfilled, the entire crate will be rejected and sent back to the manufacturing company. The beauty supply warehouse manager is interested in the probability that a crate shipped to the warehouse will be rejected. Assume that the amounts of shampoo in the bottles are independent of each other.

	i. Define the random variable of interest for the warehouse manager and state how the random variable is distributed.

	ii. Determine the probability that a crate will be rejected by the warehouse manager. Show your work.

c. To reduce the number of crates rejected by the beauty supply warehouse manager, the manufacturing company is considering adjusting the programming of the filling machine so that the amount of shampoo in each bottle is normally distributed with mean 0.56 liter and standard deviation 0.03 liter.

Would you recommend that the manufacturing company use the original programming of the filling machine or the adjusted programming of the filling machine? Provide a statistical justification for your choice.
